Advent of Code
==============

This repo contains my answers for Advent of Code.

Run the exercise with `go run main.go` in the directory for each day.

Why?
====

Primarily to learn Go. It's one thing to be familiar with a language, but
quite another to know it, and to know it requires you to write code in that
language. Advent of Code seemed like a reasonable way to at least learn the
parts of Go that don't require concurrency.

Do you happen to be doing anything silly?
=========================================

Why yes, I am! I'm coding all of this in an Android terminal emulator by the
name of Termux, which comes with its own APT-based package manager and repo.
So far, this all been unreasonably effective, and I have OpenSSH, nano, git,
and Go installed on my tablet through Termux.

The one difficulty I've run into is that neither Chrome nor Firefox provide a
way to download the test data. I could copy and paste it, but the paste buffer
seems to be a maximum of 4096 bytes, which is *tiny*.

And yes, I'm using nano, not my usual vim. Not because I particularly *like*
nano (I don't), but because vim isn't practical to use with my particular
Bluetooth keyboard. After some tweaking, I got nano to the point where it
isn't entirely useless, and at least it does syntax highlighting, and ^T can
be used to run gofmt, which is nice. I can't imagine why somebody would use
it for doing anything other than light editing if they had an alternative.
