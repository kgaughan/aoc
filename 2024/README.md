# Advent of Code 2024

I'm hoping to do everything in OCaml this year as my proficiency in that
language has fallen off a cliff due to underuse.

I'm testing the code using the ocaml toplevel rather than compiling it, which
is why some files will contain toplevel directives. If it makes sense futher
down the line, I'll rejig things to compile the code. Whether I use make or
dune is another matter, though I should probably use dune if only to get
familiar with it.

I had been thinking of using Forth too, but I'll only do that if it makes
sense: one version is plenty!
