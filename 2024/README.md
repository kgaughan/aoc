# Advent of Code 2024

I'm hoping to do everything in OCaml this year as my proficiency in that
language has fallen off a cliff due to underuse.

Build everything with `dune build`, then use `dune exec -- bin/dayXX.exe` to
run the binary for the given day.

I had been thinking of using Forth too, but I'll only do that if it makes
sense: one version is plenty!
