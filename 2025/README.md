# Advent of Code 2024

Doing things in OCaml again this year!

Build everything with `dune build`, then use `dune exec -- bin/dayXX.exe` to
run the binary for the given day.

I _might_ see if Prolog is an option this year, but I'm even rustier when it
comes to Prolog than I was last year with OCaml!
